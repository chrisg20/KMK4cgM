# LK-33i
Thank you for purchasing the new LK-33i Macro Keyboard! The functions, image, and LED lighting can all be fully customised with the LKEditor software, downloadable [here](https://github.com/chrisg20/KMK4cgM/releases/tag/v1.0).

# IMPORTANT
If your device is not recognized in LKEditor, ensure the device is visible as a usb drive (hold knob down while plugging in) and is renamed to LK-33I instead of CIRCUITPY.

# Editing with LKEditor

The download for our editing software can be found [here](https://github.com/chrisg20/KMK4cgM/releases/tag/v1.0). This is the easiest way to edit the keymaps, and should be sufficient for many users. The software is still very much in beta and feedback is welcome!

NOTE: Several features of the app are buggy. Most major issues will be fixed in the update coming 4/28/2023.

IMPORTANT! Before opening the editing software, put the macropad into editor mode. This is done by unplugging the device, then holding down the knob while plugging it into your computer. Hold the knob for a few seconds after the device is connected.

A LK-33I drive will show up like a USB flash drive in your file explorer.
